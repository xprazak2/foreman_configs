# SSL Setup
# If enabled, all communication would be verified via SSL
# NOTE that both certificates need to be signed by the same CA in order for this to work
# see http://theforeman.org/projects/smart-proxy/wiki/SSL for more information
# :ssl_certificate: /etc/foreman-proxy/ssl_cert.pem
# :ssl_ca_file: /etc/foreman-proxy/ssl_ca.pem
# :ssl_private_key: /etc/foreman-proxy/ssl_key.pem

# Hosts which the proxy accepts connections from
# commenting the following lines would mean every verified SSL connection allowed
# HTTPS: test the certificate CN
# HTTP: test the reverse DNS entry of the remote IP
:trusted_hosts:
  - centos-devel.example.com
#to deny access to all hosts use:
#:trusted_hosts: []

# verify a DNS reverse lookup against it's forward lookup
# 1.1.1.1 -> foreman.mycompany.com -> 1.1.1.1
# (default: true)
#:forward_verify: true

# SSL settings for client authentication against Foreman. If undefined, the values
# from general SSL options are used instead. Mainly useful when Foreman uses
# different certificates for its web UI and for smart-proxy requests.

# by default smart_proxy runs in the foreground. To enable running as a daemon, uncomment 'daemon' setting
#:daemon: true
# Only used when 'daemon' is set to true.
# Uncomment and modify if you want to change the default pid file '/var/run/foreman-proxy/foreman-proxy.pid'

# host and ports configuration
# host to bind ports to (possible values: *, localhost, 0.0.0.0)
#:bind_host: '*'
# http is disabled by default. To enable, uncomment 'http_port' setting
:http_port: 8000
# https is enabled if certificate, CA certificate, and private key are present in locations specifed by
# ssl_certificate, ssl_ca_file, and ssl_private_key correspondingly
# default values for https_port is 8443

# Log configuration
# Uncomment and modify if you want to change the location of the log file or use STDOUT or SYSLOG values
:log_file: /tmp/proxy.log
# Uncomment and modify if you want to change the log level
# WARN, DEBUG, ERROR, FATAL, INFO, UNKNOWN
